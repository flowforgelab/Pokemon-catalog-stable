## üéØ Why We're Migrating

**From**: Next.js 15 + Better Auth + GraphQL (Vercel + Railway + Supabase)  
**To**: Next.js 14 + Clerk + REST (All on Vercel)

**Key Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Fix OAuth redirect loops (Better Auth incompatible with Next.js 15)
- ‚úÖ Reduce costs by 54-69% (~$65/mo ‚Üí ~$25/mo)
- ‚úÖ Simplify from 3 services to 1
- ‚úÖ Remove GraphQL complexity for simple REST needs
