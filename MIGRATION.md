## 🎯 Why We're Migrating

**From**: Next.js 15 + Better Auth + GraphQL (Vercel + Railway + Supabase)  
**To**: Next.js 14 + Clerk + REST (All on Vercel)

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ Fix OAuth redirect loops (Better Auth incompatible with Next.js 15)
- ✅ Reduce costs by 54-69% (~$65/mo → ~$25/mo)
- ✅ Simplify from 3 services to 1
- ✅ Remove GraphQL complexity for simple REST needs
